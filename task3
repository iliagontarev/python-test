CHAPTER III
Oh no, you're in trouble! You forgot the sudo password for your computer.

You remember though that it was a number, and that it had some interesting properties:
There are at least two groups of identical adjacent digits (like 11 and 33 in 1123345).
Going from left to right, the digits never decrease; they only ever increase or stay the same (like 11123 or 134679). For example, the following statements are true:
111233 meets the criteria, because the digits never decrease and there are two groups of adjacent identical digits, each of them at least two digit long: 111 and 33.
123334 and 33333 do not meet the criteria, because there's only one group of adjacent identical  digits (333 and 33333, respectively).
121233 does not meet the criteria, because even though each of the digits (1, 2, 3) is repeated twice, only the two “3” are adjacent.
 It is a number in the range between 372**2 and 809**2 (both ends inclusive).

How many numbers do you have to check? Or, in other words, how many numbers meet all the three criteria?
